= Hiding the default Jupyter application

[role='_abstract']
The {productname-short} dashboard includes Jupyter as an enabled application by default.

To hide the Jupyter tile from the list of Enabled applications, edit the dashboard configuration file.

. Log in to the {openshift-platform} console as a cluster administrator.
. Open the dashboard configuration file:
.. In the *Administrator* perspective, click *Home* -> *API Explorer*.
.. In the search bar, enter `OdhDashboardConfig` to filter by kind.
.. Click the `OdhDashboardConfig` custom resource (CR) to open the resource details page.
.. Select the `redhat-ods-applications` project from the *Project* list.
.. Click the *Instances* tab.
.. Click the `odh-dashboard-config` instance to open the details page.
.. Click the *YAML* tab. 
. In the `spec:notebookController` section, set the value of `enabled` to `false` to hide the Jupyter tile from the list of Enabled applications.
. Click *Save* to apply your changes and then click *Reload* to make sure that your changes are synced to the cluster.

.Verification

In the {productname-short} dashboard, select *Applications> Enabled*. You should not see the Jupyter tile.
