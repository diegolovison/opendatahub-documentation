= Running distributed data science workloads from data science pipelines

[role='_abstract']
To run a distributed data science workload from a data science pipeline, you must first update the pipeline to include a link to your Ray cluster image.

.Prerequisites
ifdef::upstream,self-managed[]
* You have logged in to {openshift-platform} with the `cluster-admin` role.
endif::[]
ifdef::cloud-service[]
* You have logged in to OpenShift with the `cluster-admin` role.
endif::[]

ifndef::upstream[]
* You have access to a data science cluster that is configured to run distributed workloads as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_with_distributed_workloads/configuring-distributed-workloads_distributed-workloads[Configuring distributed workloads].

ifndef::upstream[]
* You have created the required Kueue resources as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_with_distributed_workloads/configuring-distributed-workloads_distributed-workloads#configuring-quota-management-for-distributed-workloads_distributed-workloads[Configuring quota management for distributed workloads].

endif::[]

ifndef::upstream[]
* Optional: You have defined a _default_ local queue for the Ray cluster by creating a `LocalQueue` resource and adding the following annotation to the configuration details for that `LocalQueue` resource, as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_with_distributed_workloads/configuring-distributed-workloads_distributed-workloads#configuring-quota-management-for-distributed-workloads_distributed-workloads[Configuring quota management for distributed workloads]:
+
[source,bash]
----
"kueue.x-k8s.io/default-queue": "true"
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you do not create a default local queue, you must specify a local queue in each pipeline.

* You have access to S3-compatible object storage.
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
* You have created a data science project.

.Procedure
ifndef::upstream[]
. Create a data connection to connect the object storage to your data science project, as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_on_data_science_projects/working-on-data-science-projects_nb-server#adding-a-data-connection-to-your-data-science-project_nb-server[Adding a data connection to your data science project].

endif::[]

ifndef::upstream[]
. Configure a pipeline server to use the data connection, as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_on_data_science_projects/working-with-data-science-pipelines_ds-pipelines#configuring-a-pipeline-server_ds-pipelines[Configuring a pipeline server].

. Configure a pipeline server to use the data connection, as described in link:{odhdocshome}/working_on_data_science_projects/#configuring-a-pipeline-server_ds-pipelines[Configuring a pipeline server].
endif::[]

. Create the data science pipeline as follows:
.. Install the `kfp` Python package, which is required for all pipelines:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ pip install kfp
----
.. Install any other dependencies that are required for your pipeline.
.. Build your data science pipeline in Python code.
+
For example, create a file named `compile_example.py` with the following content:
+
[source,Python]
----

    base_image="registry.redhat.io/ubi8/python-39:latest",

   print(ray_dashboard_uri, ray_cluster_uri)

   generate_cert.generate_tls_cert(cluster.config.name, cluster.config.namespace) <9>
   generate_cert.export_env(cluster.config.name, cluster.config.namespace)


   ray.init(address=ray_cluster_uri)
   print("Ray cluster is up and running: ", ray.is_initialized())

       return 100


   result = ray.get(train_fn.remote())

----
<1> Imports from the CodeFlare SDK the packages that define the cluster functions
<2> Imports the time package as a workaround for https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHOAIENG-6701
<3> Specifies the Ray cluster configuration: replace these example values with the values for your Ray cluster
<4> Specifies the project
<5> Specifies the location of the Ray cluster image: if using a disconnected environment, replace the default value with the location for your environment
<6> Specifies the local queue to which the Ray cluster will be submitted: you can omit this line if you configured a default local queue
<7> Creates a Ray cluster using the specified image and configuration
<8> Waits for the Ray cluster to be ready before proceeding as a workaround for https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHOAIENG-6701
<9> Enables the Ray client to connect to a secure Ray cluster that has mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) enabled; mTLS is enabled by default in the CodeFlare component in {productname-short}
<10> Replace the example details in this section with the details for your workload
<11> Removes the Ray cluster when your workload is finished
<12> Replace the example name and description with the values for your workload
<13> Compiles the Python code and saves the output in a YAML file

.. Compile the Python file (in this example, the `compile_example.py` file):
+
[source,bash]
----
$ python compile_example.py

This command creates a YAML file (in this example, `compiled-example.yaml`), which you can import in the next step.
